        <p>Lavandula (common name lavender) is a genus of 47 known species of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to the Old World and is found in Cape Verde and the Canary Islands, and from Europe across to northern and eastern Africa, the Mediterranean, southwest Asia to India. Lavender was a bath additive in regions like Persia, Rome, and Ancient Greece. These cultures used to believe that lavender helped to  purify the body and mind. It was also used in the preparation of tea for a soothing effect. Since ancient times, lavender has been extensively used to treat different ailments, including insomnia, headaches and skin problems.</p>
